### Events ###

poland.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Poland"
poland.1.d:0 "temp"
poland.1.a:0 "temp"
poland.2.t:0 "The Polish Industry Bill"
poland.2.d:0 "The last few years Poland's industrial legislation hasn't been updated at all, this has had a negative effect on the Polish people and her economy. To fix this the two parties in the Sejm have each submitted a plan. The MOW wants to lower taxes on consumer goods, and build extra civilian factories. While the PSCD wants to subsudise military factories. Which plan should we choose?"
poland.2.a:0 "Choose the MOW's plan"
poland.2.b:0 "Choose the PSCD's plan"
poland.2.c:0 "Veto the bill alltogether!"
poland.3.t:0 "The Tax Reform Bill"
poland.3.d:0 "The Polish tax system is outdated and unnecessary complicated, this lead to massive tax evasion and people being taxed rates higher than 100%. The parties in the Sejm have both submitted a plan to fix this mess. The MOW has a proposal which focuses on a slightly progressive system and the PSCD wants to implement a flat tax. Which one should we choose?"
poland.3.a:0 "Choose the MOW's plan"
poland.3.b:0 "Choose the PSCD's plan"
poland.3.c:0 "Veto the bill alltogether"
poland.4.t:0 "The freedom of speech Bill"
poland.4.d:0 "This bill was proposed by the MOW and the PSCD, this plan wants to implement a universal free speech law for all inhabitants of the kingdom of Poland, not just the Poles. This would make the baltics very happy, but a greater amount of freedom of speech also decreases the status of the monarchy and the monarch. What should we do with the bill?"
poland.4.a:0 "The Bill passes!"
poland.4.b:0 "Veto the bill!"
poland.5.t:0 "The equality Bill"
poland.5.d:0 "This bill was proposed by the MOW and the PSCD, this plan wants to implement equality for all inhabitants of the kingdom of Poland. The consequences of this bill are making the baltic citizens more happy but it will also create a short backlash because every government institute will need to reform itself to allow baltic people to use their services. What should we do with the bill?"
poland.5.a:0 "The Bill passes!"
poland.5.b:0 "Veto the bill!"
poland.6.t:0 "The Army Reform Bill"
poland.6.d:0 "In these turbulent times an improvement of out army is necessary. Two plans have been proposed. The MOW proposes to simply conscript more men in exchange for hiring less researchers, while the PSCD only wants to increase researchers. Which plan should we choose?"
poland.6.a:0 "Choose the MOW's plan"
poland.6.b:0 "Choose the PSCD's plan"
poland.6.c:0 "Veto the bill alltogether"
poland.7.t:0 "The Navy Reform Bill"
poland.7.d:0 "The Polish navy is not what is was in the past, improvements must be made, and they must be made now. The two parties have each proposed a solution to our outdated navy, the MOW wants to improve our Battleship ability while the PSCD wants to improve our complete navy. Which plan should we choose?"
poland.7.a:0 "Choose the MOW's plan"
poland.7.b:0 "Choose the PSCD's plan"
poland.7.c:0 "Veto the bill alltogether"
poland.8.t:0 "The Constitutional Amendment"
poland.8.d:0 "The constitutional status of the monarchy in the Kingdom of Poland has always been rather confusing, the MOW and the PSCD have now proposed a plan to formalise the powers of the King. They propose that the king should have less powers (including losing his vetoing right) because it is undemocratic. Should we let this bill pass and transform into a constitutional monarchy?"
poland.8.a:0 "Accept the plan"
poland.8.b:0 "Another bill, another veto!"
poland.9.t:0 "The reform of the Sejm"
poland.9.d:0 "The kingdom of Poland has been a two party monarchy since its existence after the Great War, however after we amended the constitution voices are being heard to revise our two party state as well. They want to allow the market liberals, social democrats and the social liberals. What should we do?"
poland.9.a:0 "Allow the parties at the next election"
poland.9.b:0 "Allow the parties after the next election"
poland.9.c:0 "Keep the two party state!"
