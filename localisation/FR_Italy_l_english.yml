#### Ideas ####

 ITA_italia_irredenta:0 "Italia Irredenta"
 ITA_italia_irredenta_desc:0 "Italy united officially in 1861, but their struggle for independence from Austria continued until 1919. Veneto was acquired through a plebiscite in 1866 and the capital Rome was conquered only in 1870. Thanks to the Treaty of London the Italian Nation is now formally completed with the re conquest of Trentino, Istria and Dalmazia from the Austro-Hungarian empire"
 ITA_communist_threat:0 "Communist Threat"
 ITA_communist_threat_desc:0 "Unrest in the Italian Republic has left the country vulnerable to a communist uprising. If this threat is ignored, we may see large scale Communist revolts or even a Coup in our glorious Kingdom."
 ITA_umberto_ii:0 "Umberto II"
 ITA_umberto_ii_desc:0 "Umberto II, the current King of Italy, is seen as a strong figure in his people's eyes. Umberto's brother, Victor Emmanuel III abdicated the throne during the Red Biennium, and it fell upon Umberto to lead the Italian people through a troubling time. Now Umberto must protect his people once more against the rising threats of the world."
 ITA_communist_threat_light:0 "Communist Threat"
 ITA_communist_threat_light_desc:0 "The victory of the Partito Socialdemocratico Italiano in the recent election has calmed downed the more extreme elements of the left wing. We may now be able to breath easy, knowing the redshirts are no longer at our doorstep waiting for a moment of weakness to strike."
 
 #### Events ####
 
 italy.0.t:0 "The Italian State - placeholder"
 italy.0.d:0 "Italy starts as a parliamentary kingdom led by Umberto II of Savoy, the head of government is Luigi Einaudi, a Liberal. Italy has an Internal struggle between the left and right. At the end of the war Italy was economically destructed and full of loans, that led to a series of Worker's Strike backed by the Socialist Party. The Socialist started to gain support in the population and in the government, in the meanwhile the right started to become more radical in the fear of a socialist uprising. The tension escalated quickly and the government had to make changes, the parliament called an earlier election and and a government of Centre Left was appointed with Ivanoe Bonomi as president of the council, but the Extreme Left saw him as a revisionist and the reform pushed by the government were opposed by both the extreme right and left. The Government was in a stalemate and the King Vittorio Emanuele III, proud liberal, was was threatened by the extremist. Vittorio abdicated on 30 January 1926, his son Umberto II succeeded to pacify the senate but the situation is still threatened by the Socialist Party"
 italy.0.a:0 "Fides Est Regni Tutela"
 italy.1.t:0 "The XXIX Italian Legislature"
 italy.1.d:0 "Election time has finally come again. The previous Liberal government has recovered from the disaster of the Red Biennial and has become a mainstay in Italian politics. Despite this leftist sentiments have become increasingly popular among the citizens and within parliament. This Election is expected to be an intense fight between the Unione Socialista coalition led by the Social Democrat candidate Giuseppe Saragat and between the Liberal party lead by current president of the council Luigi Einaudi, but in the wake of Black Wednesday a comeback for the more extreme factions in Italian politics, the leftist Partito Socialista or the right wing Partito Popolare is quite possible."
 italy.1.a:0 "Let the fight begin!"
 italy.2.t:0 "The Foreign Policy question"
 italy.2.d:0 "The first issue brought up in Parliament is the direction of our foreign policy. Former member of the Partito Popolare, Alcide de Gasperi, argued that Italy should pursue a closer relation with members of the Entente, especially with our Latin sister France. Palmiro Togliatti of the Communist Party alternatively stated that the Italian nation should leave the reactionary Entente and instead should align itslef with the Soviet Union however his statement was not supported by the more moderate Socialist Party or by the Social Democartic Party. The Liberals remained silent on the foreign affairs and preferred to talk on more relevant topic like the economy."
 italy.2.a:0 ""
 italy.3.t:0 "The Suffragette question"
 italy.3.d:0 "During the socialist government of Ivanoe Bonomi various reforms led to women gaining the right to vote, but little more. Today the first Italian woman deputy, Lina Merlin, a member of the socialist party spoke for total equality. The Socialist applauded her speech, while the more conservative elements of the Italian parliament were shocked by her shameless prepotency."
 italy.3.a:0 ""
 italy.4.t:0 "Internal Policy"
 italy.4.d:0 "In the last few years southern Italy and Sicily has seen a sharp rise in organised crime. Parliament is now forced to consider substantial reforms. Don Luigi Sturzo, leader of Partito Popolare and a Sicilian himself, suggested that an increase in funding and a statute giving Sicily more autonomy would help the island region fight the Crime Families. The democratic socialist party wishes to pursue a broader goal of decentralization for the regions of Italy. The Communist suggested to create Anti-Mafia militias squad to protect the people. The Liberals preferred to maintain the status quo but promised to fight organized crime."
 italy.4.a:0 ""
 italy.5.t:0 "Economic reforms"
 italy.5.d:0 "After the Great War, Italy faced an economic depression and became burried deep in debt. The previous government was achieving a slow recovery but with the new global crisis started by Black Wednesday the Italian economy found itself again on the brink of collapse. The leftist coalition is trying to push for the creation of a welfare state or "Stato Sociale". The Communist of course are pushing for collectivization and the redistribution of the means of production. Liberals and Conservatives both support mild state intervention only if needed."
