 #### Events ####
 
 italy.0.t:0 "The Italian State - placeholder"
 italy.0.d:0 "Italy starts as a parliamentary kingdom led by Umberto II of Savoy, the head of government is Luigi Einaudi, a Liberal. Italy has an Internal struggle between the left and right. At the end of the war Italy was economically destructed and full of loans, that led to a series of Worker's Strike backed by the Socialist Party. The Socialist started to gain support in the population and in the government, in the meanwhile the right started to become more radical in the fear of a socialist uprising. The tension escalated quickly and the government had to make changes, the parliament called an earlier election and and a government of Centre Left was appointed with Ivanoe Bonomi as president of the council, but the Extreme Left saw him as a revisionist and the reform pushed by the government were opposed by both the extreme right and left. The Government was in a stalemate and the King Vittorio Emanuele III, proud liberal, was was threatened by the extremist. Vittorio abdicated on 30 January 1926, his son Umberto II succeeded to pacify the senate but the situation is still threatened by the Socialist Party"
 italy.0.a:0 "Fides Est Regni Tutela"
 italy.1.t:0 "The XXIX Italian Legislature"
 italy.1.d:0 "Election time has finally come again. The previous Liberal government has recovered from the disaster of the Red Biennial and has become a mainstay in Italian politics. Despite this leftist sentiments have become increasingly popular among the citizens and within parliament. This Election is expected to be an intense fight between the Unione Socialista coalition led by the Social Democrat candidate Giuseppe Saragat and between the Liberal party lead by current president of the council Luigi Einaudi, but in the wake of Black Wednesday a comeback for the more extreme factions in Italian politics, the leftist Partito Socialista or the right wing Partito Popolare is quite possible."
 italy.1.a:0 "Let the fight begin!"
 italy.2.t:0 "The Foreign Policy question"
 italy.2.d:0 "The first issue brought up in Parliament is the direction of our foreign policy. Former member of the Partito Popolare, Alcide de Gasperi, argued that Italy should pursue a closer relation with members of the Entente, especially with our Latin sister France. Palmiro Togliatti of the Communist Party alternatively stated that the Italian nation should leave the reactionary Entente and instead should align itslef with the Soviet Union however his statement was not supported by the more moderate Socialist Party or by the Social Democartic Party. The Liberals remained silent on the foreign affairs and preferred to talk on more relevant topic like the economy."
 italy.2.a:0 "The USSR is the core of the Revolution, we should support them."
 italy.2.b:0 "The Liberals are right, We should focus on domestic affairs first."
 italy.2.c:0 "Togliatti is a fool, but he isn't completely wrong..."
 italy.2.e:0 "De Gasperi is right, we should support the Entente."
 italy.3.t:0 "The Suffragette question"
 italy.3.d:0 "During the socialist government of Ivanoe Bonomi various reforms led to women gaining the right to vote, but little more. Today the first Italian woman deputy, Lina Merlin, a member of the socialist party spoke for total equality. The Socialist applauded her speech, while the more conservative elements of the Italian parliament were shocked by her shameless prepotency."
 italy.3.a:0 "Applaud her effort! Women are a cornerstone of the Revolution."
 italy.3.b:0 "Interesting but she's too radical."
 italy.3.c:0 "Commend her effort! We must always consider the perspective of Women."
 italy.3.e:0 "Politics is not place for a Woman."
 italy.4.t:0 "Internal Policy"
 italy.4.d:0 "In the last few years southern Italy and Sicily has seen a sharp rise in organised crime. Parliament is now forced to consider substantial reforms. Don Luigi Sturzo, leader of Partito Popolare and a Sicilian himself, suggested that an increase in funding and a statute giving Sicily more autonomy would help the island region fight the Crime Families. The democratic socialist party wishes to pursue a broader goal of decentralization for the regions of Italy. The Communist suggested to create Anti-Mafia militias squad to protect the people. The Liberals preferred to maintain the status quo but promised to fight organized crime."
 italy.4.a:0 "The Militia would wipe out all those Mafia scum!"
 italy.4.b:0 "The current policies are working fine"
 italy.4.c:0 "Decentralization is necessary for a state like Italy."
 italy.4.e:0 "Luigi Sturzo has good ideas."
 italy.5.t:0 "Economic reforms"
 italy.5.d:0 "After the Great War, Italy faced an economic depression and became burried deep in debt. The previous government was achieving a slow recovery but with the new global crisis started by Black Wednesday the Italian economy found itself again on the brink of collapse. The leftist coalition is trying to push for the creation of a welfare state or "Stato Sociale". The Communist of course are pushing for collectivization and the redistribution of the means of production. Liberals and Conservatives both support mild state intervention only if needed."
 italy.5.a:0 "We must seize the means of production!"
 italy.5.b:0 "The economy is recovering fine"
 italy.5.c:0 "A Welfare state would be the favorable option"
 italy.5.e:0 "Economic reform is a slippery slope towards Communism"

 italy.10.t:0 "The Communists have won"
 italy.10.d:0 "In a surprise victory, the Communist party have won the election. While the results are very controversial little eveidence of fraud can be found. This has not stopped many on the right from protesting against the party though. Many are worried that this is the end of Italian democracy as we know it and some even claim that a one party Communist state is right around the corner. Antonio Gramsci's connections to the Soviet Union have not helped calm these fears. While it would be hypocritical for us to deny the communist their democratic victory sometimes scrafices must be made for the greater good"
 italy.10.a:0 "Congratulations Comrades!"
 italy.10.b:0 "Only the military can save Italy now."
 italy.11.t:0 "The Progressives have won"
 italy.11.d:0 "The Partito Socialdemocratico Italiano were seen to be the only party capable of beating the Partito Liberale Italiano in the election and after a hard faught campaign they have come out victorious. Many voters who have become disilusioned with the Liberals see the party a the only other sensible choice in Italy. Even many of the more moderate Communists admit that thier victory may be a good thing for country. Now in power the progressives will hopefully fulfill their campaign promises and introduce a welfare system to Italy. Hopefully this will lead to a path of quick economic recovery."
 italy.11.a:0 "In times of crisis meaningful change must occur"
 italy.12.t:0 "The Liberals have won"
 italy.12.d:0 "Despite their diminishing populiarity, the Partito Liberale Italiano have won the election. It will be a rough few years ahead for Luigi Einaudi and his party. The Socialists blame his Laissez-faire economic policies for the recent depression impacting Italy while The right wing criticize his party his party for being weak and ineffectual. Despite this the Partito Liberale Italiano will continue to be a mainstay in Italian politics for some time"
 italy.12.a:0 "We must not let extremist tear Italy appart"
 italy.13.t:0 "The Military storm Parliament"
 italy.13.d:0 "The last election's failiure to determine a suitable government has forced the military, lead by Italo Balbo and Pietro Badoglio, to march into the streets of Rome and storm the Parliament Building. The majority of the deputies submitted to the coup while the few who tried to oppose, mostly Socialists, were dragged outside and executed by firing squad. Now that the military has seized control some leaders like Luigi Capello, a hero of the Great War, suggest a quick restoration of a civillian government while Pietro Badoglio instead proposed to invite the third duke of Savoy-Aosta, Amedeo, to become head of state but rumors are rampant that Italo Balbo may use his new found influence to proclaim himself dictator or "Duce" of Italy."
 italy.13.a:0 "We must bring stability to our nation"
 italy.15.t:0 "The Conservative have won"
 italy.15.d:0 "In an unexpected outcome the Partito Popolare lead by Luigi Sturzo have won the election. Most Communist are furious at the results and many have already started protesting in the streets. Luigi Sturzo does not seem to be worried by this though and promises to 'deal with' extremists who threaten the stability of Italy. The Conservatives promise to develope the Italian colonial empire and maintain strong relation with the Entente, which many see as a move motivated by Sturzo's strong anti-Soviet views. Conservative voters now expect the Luigi Sturzo to protect traditional Italian culture and lead the nation towards economic recovery"
 italy.15.a:0 "Long Live Italy!"
 italy.16.t:0 "Who should lead Italy?"
 italy.16.d:0 "The coup leaders have convened to make the final decision on which direction Italy must be lead. The meeting was tense and arguements lasted for hours but it seems a plan has finnally been set."
 italy.16.a:0 "The coup's leader, Italo Balbo, has been declared 'Duce' of Italy"
 italy.16.b:0 "Amadeo Aosta is a strong and capable leader"

The leftist in the party believe we need to give more autonomy to our oversea possesions while those who lean right believe we must use the military and police force to crush the any dissidents who challenge our rule. With tentions slowly getting worse in Libya a policy must be chosen soon"
 italy.20.a:0 "The people in our colonies deserve autonomy"
