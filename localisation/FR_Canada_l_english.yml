CAN_canadas_fair_domain:0 "Canada's fair Domain"
CAN_canadas_fair_domain_desc:0 "We fought in the hell that was the Great War. We fought in the trenches, we fought in the fields, we fought from the Artillery batteries, in the skies and in the early armoured beasts that are now known as Tanks. Despite all our fighting we never earned any more Autonomy, and still are firmly under Britannia's wing. We always expected to remain a Dominion, however we believed that London would recognize our efforts and at least compensate us in some way. Perhaps we can use these recent memories to leverage some reforms..."
CAN_canada_carries_on:0 "Canada Carries On"
CAN_canada_carries_on_desc:0 "The National Film Board of Canada has requested additional funding in order to create a series of Propaganda short films. The films will cover a wild range of topics, ranging from simply encouraging men to join the Army to in-depth training videos to demonstrate how certain types of equipment are to be handled."
CAN_nrma:0 "NRMA"
CAN_nrma_desc:0 "The National Resource Mobilization Act is a very unpopular proposition to say the least. It involves conscription across the entire Country and employment regulations for young men that are eligible for Military Service. This will surely help us operate at peak efficiency and assist us in the War effort; however it will also upset the population."
CAN_the_war_measures_act:0 "The War Measures Act"
CAN_the_war_measures_act_desc:0 "The last time the War Measures act was invoked was during the Great War. It shall be invoked again. The War measures act will grant us sweeping powers and allow the suspension of Civil Liberties and personal freedoms. With this, we will be able to completely and utterly dedicate ourselves to the war."
CAN_anglo_conscription:0 "Anglo Conscription"
CAN_anglo_conscription_desc:0 "We have learned in the Great War that the Quebecois would rather fight as free men than fight as Conscripts. Instead of Conscripting from Quebec, we will conduct large scale propaganda efforts instead. Conscription will only take place in Anglo-Canada."
CAN_increase_recruitment_efforts:0 "Increase Recruitment efforts"
CAN_increase_recruitment_efforts_desc:0 "Every man that can should serve in the Canadian Corps. We can never have enough volunteers, and at the moment we are lacking some. Expanding our propaganda campaign will hopefully lead to an influx of volunteers."

CAN_radar:0 "R.A.D.A.R"

### Industry ###

CAN_fund_oil_exploitation:0 "Fund Oil Exploitation"
CAN_fund_oil_exploitation_desc:0 "Alberta has large deposits of Oil, ripe for exploitation. Our economic boom has permitted us to continue to fund extraction of large portions of resources within Canada, and this is no exception. Additionally; a member of the Empire also being able to export large quantities of Oil to Britain herself would have immeasurable value for both parties."
CAN_black_wednesday_initiatives:0 "Black Wednesday Initiatives"
CAN_black_wednesday_initiatives_desc:0 "Our period of Economic prosperity is over... For now. This ripples of tragedy has struck us, which was only to be predicted. However it is not over for Canada. We will persevere. And we will tell the Public that we will persevere, and how we intend on doing it."
CAN_expand_the_dbs:0 "Expand the D.B.S"
CAN_expand_the_dbs_desc:0 "The Dominion Bureau of Statistics (Or D.B.S for short) was formed in 1918 in accordance with the Statistics Act. They are responsible for holding censuses within the Nation; however don't do anything outside of that. The D.B.S would be much more useful if we expanded its responsibility to also include the production of Population statistics, Economic statistics and more.
# (Note, gains national spirit 'The DBS' which grants +5% monthly population growth, +5% factory output)
CAN_statistics_canada:0 "Statistics Canada"
CAN_statistics_canada_desc:0 "Now with our newfound independence; the D.B.S shall be reformed into Statistics Canada, with even further expansion."
# Removes national spirit 'The DBS'
CAN_expand_the_rcmp:0 "Expand the RCMP"
CAN_expand_the_rcmp_desc:0 "The Royal Canadian Mounted Police hold a legacy in Canada. There is little they were incapable of doing and they have accomplished many admirable tasks. They are also responsible for infiltrating and dismantling Political Groups that might be considered dangerous to Canada. As the name might imply, many of them are Pro-British, and what exactly they might consider dangerous to Canada could end up becoming subjective."
CAN_polycorp:0 "PolyCorp"
CAN_polycorp_desc:0 "PolyCorp, or more formally known as Polymer Corporation, will allow us to produce rubber locally instead of relying on overseas trade. Whilst it is unlikely that the other members of the Empire will import Nylon or synthetic rubber, at least it will allow us to become more self-sufficient. "

CAN_mines_in_the_iron_range_desc:0 "For a long time, the Americans have had mines on their side of the Iron range and it has been incredibly profitable for them, as they are some of the most Iron rich areas in North America currently. However the Iron range stretches into Northern Ontario... Who's to say we can't capitalize on what's rightfully ours?"

CAN_inglis_arms_desc:0 "John Inglis and Company, commonly known as simply Inglis, has specialized in producing arms since 1859; before the remaining North American Colonies were Federated into the Dominion of Canada.

CAN_canadian_pacific_railway:0 "Canadian Pacific Railway"
CAN_canadian_pacific_railway_desc:0 "The Canadian Pacific Railway took over 4 years to build, ending in 1885. It was a costly but valuable investment, it connected the West and East of Canada and reduced division between the two.  Expansion of the railway should be a priority and Government headed initiative. "
CAN_relief_camps:0 "Relief Camps"
CAN_relief_camps_desc:0 "The Red Tories have put forward an interesting but morally vague idea. The proposition is state administered 'Work Relief Camps'. These camps are intended to grant more job opportunities to the Populace, however the truth lies a little bit deeper than that. The average camp worker would perform menial, tiresome, labour intensive tasks. They'd be provided with food, shelter, and warmth while employed in the camp but with very poor pay. "

### Army ###

CAN_spearhead_of_the_empire:0 "'Spearhead of the Empire'"
CAN_spearhead_of_the_empire_desc:0 "In the Great War the Canadian Corps earned a large amount of prestige due to the effectiveness of Canadian Soldiers. Canadians became a constant pain for the Germans who considered them a stubborn and unyielding enemy. By no means is the Canadian Military outdated; however with prestige comes responsibility. And in our case the responsibility is keeping the Royal Canadian Army a highly elite and disciplined force."

## Crerar's Path ##

CAN_crerars_lightning_warfare:0 "Crerar's Lightning Warfare"
CAN_crerars_lightning_warfare_desc:0 "Harry Crerar is a less popular but nonetheless respected General in the Canadian Army. Quickly climbing the Ranks in the Great War he ended up being amazed at the efficiency Armoured warfare was able to root out enemy positions. An advocate of increased Armoured production and phasing out Leg-Infantry; Crerar not so subtly hints at a new type of Warfare revolving around speed and armoured beasts."
CAN_army_of_mobility:0 "Army of Mobility"
CAN_army_of_mobility_desc:0 "Many believe that Leg Infantry will be the core of any army. For their own they may be correct, however we will take the initiative in this new age of warfare.

CAN_field_aid_and_field_support:0 "Field Aid & Field Support"
CAN_field_aid_and_field_support_desc:0 "War is a horrible experience for the average soldier. There are too many situations in which a man dies when he could've been saved given the proper care.
