#### Ideas ####

FRA_great_war_victors:0 "Victors Of The Great War"
FRA_great_war_victors_desc:0 "When the dust had finally settled at the end of the war, we, alongside Britain, the United States, and a multitude of other countries, had emerged victorious from the Great War. While this has been a huge boost to our national pride, our army is very complacent and unwilling to reform."
FRA_rhineland_coal:0 "Coal From The Rhineland"
FRA_rhineland_coal_desc:0 "With the acquisition of the Rhineland from Germany after the Great War, we have seen a surplus of coal, a resource badly needed for the French industry. So long as we remain in control of the Rhineland, we can ensure that our industrial capacity and profits are at an all time high."


#### Focuses ####

### Army ###

FRA_the_land_army:0 "The Land Army"
FRA_the_land_army_desc:0 "Despite emerging victorious from the Great War, our army is in poor shape. While our men are well equipped, the Great War saw France undergo a huge demographic loss of men from the ages of eighteen to twenty five. If we are to keep Europe safe from the German menace, we must ensure our army is in top shape."
FRA_mechanized_warfare:0 "Mechanized Warfare"
FRA_mechanized_warfare_desc:0 "Charles de Gaulle, a Land Army officer, has expressed sentiments in favour of using tanks, mechanized infantry, planes, and other types of armour as the primary doctrine for the Land Army. While his ideas are not popular with the French high command, perhaps it is time we began to use offensive tactics?"
FRA_motorized_infantry:0 "Motorized Infantry"
FRA_motorized_infantry_desc:0 "Using motorized infantry, which is much quicker than regular infantry, we can move at high speeds towards the enemy’s position and squeeze out a quick victory!"
FRA_airplane_technology:0 "Airplane Technology"
FRA_airplane_technology_desc:0 "A key component of de Gaulle’s plan was the concentration of airplanes during war. Maintaining air superiority and bombing enemy positions will be key to a rapid victory."
FRA_tank_production:0 "Tank Production"
FRA_tank_production_desc:0 "The most crucial aspect to de Gaulle’s plan is the creation of new tanks. Tanks are able to punch through lines and create encirclements, effectively forcing the enemy to surrender and granting us a swift and easy victory."
FRA_artillery_barrage:0 "Artillery Barrage"
FRA_artillery_barrage_desc:0 "Artillery shells are able to reach places much further than infantry, meaning that we can use it to create a protective umbrella for our soldiers, lessening the loss of lives."
FRA_support_companies:0 "Support Companies"
FRA_support_companies_desc:0 "Investing in new technology for support companies in order to help strengthen our divisions would make for a good investment."
FRA_artillery_production:0 "Artillery Production"
FRA_artillery_production_desc:0 "Since artillery is a key component of our new doctrine, it is only natural that we take steps to produce more of it."
FRA_offensive_training:0 "Offensive Training"
FRA_offensive_training_desc:0 "The Land Army has operated on a doctrine of defence during and following the Great War. It is important that we teach our soldiers to take initiative, so that our men can carry out their orders to best of their abilities."
FRA_levee_en_masse:0 "Levee en Masse"
FRA_levee_en_masse_desc:0 "Levée en masse, or mass levy, was a policy of mass conscription adopted by France during the aftermath of the French Revolution of 1789. Since we are lacking in manpower, perhaps we could look to conscript older men into the army..."
FRA_mass_production_of_infantry_equipment:0 "Mass Production of Infantry Equipment"
FRA_mass_production_of_infantry_equipment_desc:0 "If we are to replace the manpower gap that exists within the Land Army, it is only logical that every man receives a rifle, no matter how poorly made it is."
FRA_mandatory_draft:0 "Mandatory Draft"
FRA_mandatory_draft_desc:0 "The policy of Levée en Masse is no longer enough. We must begin to institute a mandatory draft to ensure that every able-bodied Frenchman will fight for their country."
FRA_militarization:0 "Militarization"
FRA_militarization_desc:0 "More factories must be created to build more guns for more men."
FRA_careful_planning:0 "Careful Planning"
FRA_careful_planning_desc:0 "It would be best to plan for each and every scenario as that would ensure that we will be prepared and ready for anything that may come our way. In addition, building more forts on the Alsace-Rhine line will intimidate the Germans, ensuring that they will not act up."
FRA_military_academies:0 "Military Academies"
FRA_military_academies_desc:0 "Encouraging civilians to enrol in military academies  will help widen and develop our officer pool, giving us more of the finest minds to choose from."
FRA_alsace_rhine_line:0 "Alsace-Rhine Line"
FRA_alsace_rhine_line_desc:0 "The Alsace-Rhine Line, our primary defence against the German menace, has served well to deter the Germans from attacking us. Therefore, it is only natural that we continue to develop the existing fortifications further."
FRA_the_guard_on_the_rhine:0 "The Guard on the Rhine"
FRA_the_guard_on_the_rhine_desc:0 "After the Great War, we saw to it that the German menace had been permanently weakened, so that they could never embroil Europe in yet another conflict. We, the French, are the true guardians of the Rhine and, by extension, the guardians of Europe. Vive la France!"
FRA_the_army_reformed:0 "The Army Reformed"
FRA_the_army_reformed_desc:0 "Rigorous training, new tactics, and weapons production have all seen the Land Army advance much further than ever before. Our army now stands ready at attention, more prepared than it has ever been."

### Air Force ###

FRA_air_army:0 "Air Army"
FRA_air_army_desc:0 "The French Air Army, ever since the conclusion of the Great War, has been slipping in both numbers and quality to the German Air Force. If we are to hold our own in the skies, we must ensure our air force receive a priority."
FRA_aerial_doctrines:0 "Aerial Doctrines"
FRA_aerial_doctrines_desc:0 "What good is a pilot if he is unable to fly a plane? We will ensure that our pilots are educated so as to set high standards for the Air Army."
FRA_commission_new_bombers:0 "Commission new Bombers"
FRA_commission_new_bombers_desc:0 "Bombing our enemies into submission and destroying their supply lines, infrastructure, and factories is the way to go."
FRA_invest_in_fighter_planes:0 "Invest in Fighter Planes"
FRA_invest_in_fighter_planes_desc:0 "Maintaining aerial superiority and destroying the enemy’s planes is the most important aspect of warfare."
FRA_light_aircraft_industry:0 "Light Aircraft Industry"
FRA_light_aircraft_industry_desc:0 "Investing in the light aircraft industry would be a wise choice for the Air Army."
FRA_close_air_support:0 "Close Air Support"
FRA_close_air_support_desc:0 "Combining de Gaulle’s idea of concentrating on airplanes and quickly securing victory, it would only make sense for us to continue down this route and invest in close air support."
FRA_heavy_aircraft_industry:0 "Heavy Aircraft Industry"
FRA_heavy_aircraft_industry_desc:0 "Pouring investments in the heavy aircraft industry is the right option for the Air Army."
FRA_naval_aircraft:0 "Naval Aircraft"
FRA_naval_aircraft_desc:0 "Bombers that can be refueled and fight from the high seas will be extremely important in exacting lethal damage towards enemy ships."
FRA_paratrooper_technology:0 "Paratrooper Technology"
FRA_paratrooper_technology_desc:0 "Instead of primarily relying on planes, we could also shift our focus to include paratroopers."
