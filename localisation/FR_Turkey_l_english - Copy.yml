serbia.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Serbia"
serbia.1.d:0 "After the end of the Great War Serbia was left in disaster. Many cities were left in ruins and corruption far deep within the government was prevalent. King Alexander I established his position as an absolute ruler with his son, Peter Karađorđević, as heir. In addition, the Balkans are divided with the Italians holding the Adriatic Coast and Hungarians holding central Croatia. King Alexander attempted to regain the territories through diplomacy in order to achieve his dream of creating and ruling a new, united Balkan nation. However, the King had heard that Croatian politicians seek to break free from Hungary and connect with their historical lands on Adriatic Coast. Alexander, fearing a potential coalition between Italy and Croatia, ordered an assassination on three leading Croat politicians. The plot succeeded and Croatia was diplomatically weakened. In the 1930's Alexander appointed new ministers with the goal of rebuilding Serbia both militarily and economically for the inevitable war against Hungary. As the months passed, the King’s paranoia increased. His cabinet noticed that and nobody was safe from potential political exile except his son and his cousin, Paul Karadjordjevic. Serbian international relations hit rock bottom. Since the Entente failed to give Serbia the territory they had requested and rightfully deserved, King Alexander I tried to convince the United Kingdom that Serbia was a victim and must shown the proper respect for their contribution against Austria-Hungary. After the United Kingdom declined both territorial concessions and war reparations,  the Serbian peoples’ opinion began to turn against the King. Alexander's position was questioned and the people are divided between the Paternal Autocrats and the growing National Populists led by Svetozar Pribićević. Who knows what lies ahead, but Balkan area is still the 'Powder keg of Europe'."
