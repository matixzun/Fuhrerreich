worldnews.1.d:0 "On this day, the 13th of January, 1936, Sultan Abdulmecid II was very suddenly shot and killed by an unknown assailant! The local Gendarmerie were unable to react in time to save the Sultan, killing the assailant only after the fatal shot that left the Sultan dead. Despite the unpopularity of the Ottoman dynasty after the Great War, Sultan Abdulmecid II and the rest of the Ottoman Royal Family were backed by the Entente powers and kept the empire relatively stable. With the death of the Sultan, uncertainty now rules Turkey."
